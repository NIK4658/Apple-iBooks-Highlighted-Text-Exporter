### This Python script exports all **notes, books and authors** from the *iBooks database* to a *private database*

This application also manages *authors and books* by creating **records and automatic links** in the private database.

For each book, author and note, the script will create a **new record with all possible important fields.**

The script **automatically handles already existing notes, books and authors.**

**The structure of the database** where the notes will be stored *is available in the repository*.
